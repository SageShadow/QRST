Author’s Statement and References

All governing equations and notational systems presented are complete and sufficient for theoretical validation and peer review. Certain calibration routines, simulation codes, and parameter optimization methods are withheld or simplified to protect the author’s intellectual property. Direct implementation or reproduction at scale may require additional details, which are available for licensing or research collaboration upon request.

This work was created independently by Shadow Sage, without formal academic background in physics or mathematics. All models, theories, and concepts are original to the author, developed through direct experience and intuition. All mathematical notation, equations, and simulation methods were constructed with the assistance of a large language model (LLM), based on the author’s explanations and conceptual framework.

General mathematical and computational approaches used herein are common knowledge and public domain (e.g., basic calculus, field equations, Fourier transforms, entropy measures).
No direct use of or reference to academic publications, textbooks, or proprietary software was made in the formulation of this work.
AI Assistance Declaration: All advanced mathematical content was generated or verified through interactive use of a large language model (LLM).
Any similarities to published work are coincidental, except where standard terms or equations are necessary for understanding.

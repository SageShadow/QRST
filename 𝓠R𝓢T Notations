𝓠R𝓢T Notations

Notation: Label   Meaning/Scope

ω:   Angular frequency Frequency of recursion angular “radians per second”

Æ:   Collapse amplitude pre factor Exponential amplitude pre factor in collapse laws. Sets the max collapse strength.

ϰ:   Collapse rate coefficient General decay likelihood:  ϰ is a ratio, not a fixed number

Ɣ:   Coupling Coupling constant; modulates interactions, collapse, or feedback

α_𝓢:   Diffusion mobility Controls linear spreading (mobility)

𝓶_eft:   Effective inertial mass Proportional to density and λ^2

𝓢:   Entropy Entropy; disorder or randomness in the qualia field

𝓢_ϰ_rte:   Entropy collapse rate Entropy collapse rate; rate of entropy-induced field collapse

∇:   Gradient Gradual change

∇ϑ_fld :   Gradient field phase Gradient of phase field; spatial rate of change of field phase

i:   Index Index; integer counter or label in sums, series, or arrays

ʪ:   Loss coefficient General dissipation rate (Loss)

Ṁ:   Möbius Standard Möbius topology, single phase inversion per cycle. Used for reference, but not structurally unique to QRST.

ln:   Natural logarithm Natural logarithm; log base e (mathematical function)

β_𝓢:   Nonlinear aggregation Decay constant in clarity evolution

∂/∂t:   Partial derivative Partial differentiation with respect to time

ϰ_𝓺:   Qualia collapse rate Collapse rate coefficient for (𝓺). Governs the intrinsic rate at which qualia patterns collapse due to entropy, clarity, and internal phase gradients. 

𝓺(x, t):   Qualia density field Base qualia field. All recursion acts within this field. Defines how much qualia is present per unit volume. Local

∇𝓺(x, t):   Qualia Gradient The change or slope of qualia density across space. 

ĝ (x,t):   Qualia gravity The field equivalent of ‘gravity’ for qualia bends the stream, driving sealed recursion and influences ray trajectory. Induced by ∇𝓺

Ξ:   Qualia mass constant The universal proportionality constant relating bits to mass in the QRST framework.

σ_𝓢(x, t):   Qualia Spatial Clarity This is the local inverse entropy, clarity per location, used in almost every collapse law.

Ψ(x,t):   Qualia Stream Amplitude This is the Global amplitude, what moves, collapses, locks, and sustains. (Complex) Amplitude of recursive structure in 𝓺

Ʀ:   Recursion depth The count of recursive nesting or levels within a domain or loop.

δ:   Recursion frequency Frequency linear “cycles per second”

ϑ:   Recursion phase angle Local phase orientation of a recursion or loop; advances with time or traversal. Used for synchronization and collapse targeting.

𝓺_clo(x,t):   Sealed Internal Lock Region where recursion flux = 0. Marks a zone that will no longer interact with external recursion, defines true sealed loops.

𝓴:   Spatial wavenumber Controls lobe count/symmetry

𝓺_str(x, t):   Structured qualia density Portion of 𝓺(x, t) that has acquired recursive structure. Extracted from Ψ.

Ĝ:   Ti Diĝir Sets the topological class for non-orientable recursion in QRST. All rays or streams passing through Ṁ undergo phase inversion and topological memory locking.

λ:   Wavelength Wavelength; spatial period of oscillatory field

𝔀:   Weighting Weighting; weighting factor or filter in sums or transforms

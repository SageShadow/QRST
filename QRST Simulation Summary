QRST Simulation Summary

*Collapse Law Validation
Setup:  
- Grid: 256 × 256  
- Steps: 1,500  
Result:  
- Collapse rate ϰ increases with local phase-gradient magnitude and is suppressed exponentially at higher entropy, as predicted by the CET law.
- No manual parameter fitting needed; data aligned with theory across all resolutions.
Key Finding:  
Confirms both entropy and phase twist jointly determine collapse probability.

*Mass Law Validation

Setup:
- Step 700: persistent sealed structures identified/analyzed.
Result:  
- Measured mass for each structure matched theoretical prediction within 10% error.
Key Finding:  
Effective mass is directly proportional to structured qualia density and recursion scale.

*Attractor States

QCC1 (Cartesian Crystallization): 
- Formation of central density lattices, clear orthogonal quantization, outer collapse ring.
- FFT diagnostics confirmed harmonic and cross-resonance modes.

QCC2 (Full-Domain Lattice):  
- Dense, concentric banding with minimal entropy.
- FFT confirmed quantized spatial resonance and “memory attractor” state.

QTDCC_U (Topological Memory Crystallization):  
- Ultra-high closure thresholds, 10,000 steps.
- Domain-wide lobe-shaped memory bands formed after harmonic synchronization.
- Mass, entropy, compression showed collapse, rebound, and plateau as closure propagated.

Interpretation:  
Memory crystallization confirmed: only perfectly ordered, phase-locked regions can seal; closure propagates by topological “infection.”
